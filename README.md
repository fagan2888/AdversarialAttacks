# AdversarialAttacks


The aim of this study is to understand some classical problems related to adversarial at- tacks that are presented by Goodfellow et al. in [1]. Multiple approaches are proposed to underline the properties of the adversarial attacks. In particular, we try to reproduce and observe some attacks properties exposed in Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks, Madry et al. [2].
